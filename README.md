# Image Gallery
### Using jQuery and Ajax


-> This is how the website looks when you first open it

-> Select image and enter username


-> Upload the image. This uploads directly to the folder and to the database which consists of => image_name, image_size, date_uploaded, username, location(file_path) 


-> Get particular images with respect to the username


-> Selected username (batman)


-> We can update other features also but in my website we can update the username of an image (first image user name: wanted)


-> Select image to update (updated user name: pavan)


-> Every image has an "x" icon which deletes the image from the database and local folder


-> Image is deleted (Look at the first image before and after)


-> This is how database looks


-> This is how the folder looks where images are stored in local pc
